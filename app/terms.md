A term defined in the Levelling Up and Regeneration Act 2023, section 84(3). 
“Approved data standards”, in relation to planning data, are such written standards, containing technical specifications or other requirements in relation to the data, or in relation to providing or processing the data, as may be published by an appropriate authority from time to time.

    <dd class='govuk-summary-list__value'>
      <p>Users have had the opportunity to test these specifications to confirm they include the required data and that we understand as far as possible the impacts on users conforming to the specification.</p> 
      <p>We expect these specifications to remain largely unchanged with only monor revisions anticipated. These form the technical specification input to the ‘approved data standards’.</p>

    <dd class='govuk-summary-list__value'>
      <p>A declarative model has a formal structure and rules that computers can easily process and interpret – these are created to automate tasks, allow data exchange, and allow different systems and software to communicate with each other.</p>
      <p>A way of describing data by saying what it should look like, not how to build it. It’s like writing a recipe, not doing the cooking.</p>
      <p>A declarative model is an output from developing the pilot specification.</p>
